# Credit Flow (credit-flow)

Web application for managing a credit application flow using Vue 3 and Vuetify

This project consists of a web application built with Vue.js 3 and Vuetify to create a simple, functional credit application flow. It includes three screens to enter the identity document issuance date, select the credit payment date, and show a summary of the entered information. The solution is responsive, modular, and follows a clean design based on Vuetify.

Validated Functional Screens:

    Enter issuance date with validation (not future date, after 01/01/1950).
    Select a payment date from three available options.
    Final summary displaying entered data.

Internationalization (i18n):

    Dynamic language switching between Spanish and English.
    Language persistence using localStorage.

Date Handling:

    Date validation and manipulation powered by a date library dayjs for accuracy and simplicity.

Responsive Design:

    Adaptable to different screen sizes using Vuetify components.

Modularity and Best Practices:

    Clean, well-documented code.
    Use of composables for reusable logic.
    Component-based structure for maintainability and scalability.

Technologies Used

    Vue 3: Framework for reactive structure and logic.
    Vuetify: UI library for styled components and responsive design.
    Vue Router: Navigation between screens.
    Vue I18n: Internationalization support.
    Date Library: For date parsing, validation, and formatting dayjs.
    Vite: Fast bundler for development and production.

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
